                            <p>An outswinger is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket. It is bowled by swing bowlers. An outswinger is bowled by holding the cricket ball with the seam at an angle and the first two fingers running along either side of the seam. Once the ball has worn and been polished so that one side is rougher than the other, the rough side is placed on the left. When the bowler delivers the ball, he angles the seam so that it points slightly to the left as well, and releases the ball rotating about a vertical axis with the seam along the rotational axis. The angle of the seam to the direction of motion produces an aerofoil effect as the ball moves through the air, pushing it to the left. This is enhanced by differential air pressure caused by movement of air over the rough and smooth surfaces, which also tends to push the ball to the left. The result is that the ball curves, or swings to the left. From a right-handed batsman's point of view, the swing is away from his body towards his right, i.e. towards the off side. This swing away from the body is the source of the name outswinger.</p>

                            <p>Swing is a term that describes how a cricket ball will move laterally in the air once it has left the bowlers hand. Instead of travelling in a straight line towards the batsman, the ball will curve through the air. Some bowlers will swing the ball away from the batsman – this is called outswing. Some bowlers will make the ball swing in towards the batsman – this is called inswing.</p>

                            <p>In the sport of cricket, a bouncer (or bumper) is a type of short-pitched delivery, usually bowled by a fast bowler, which bounces once and then reaches the batsman at head-height. Bouncers are used to drive the batsman back on to his back foot if he has been freely playing front foot scoring shots, such as drives. To this end, bouncers are usually directed more or less at the line of the batsman's body. Aiming at the batsman is legal provided the ball bounces on the pitch; or upon reaching the batsman, the ball is below the batsman's waist. Aiming at the batsman's head without bouncing on the pitch, known as a beamer, is illegal.</p>

                            <p>A yorker could be described as the king of all bowls. It's when the ball lands directly at the batter's feet, and it's extremely difficult to hit. Oxford dictionaries suggests that the term was coined because players from York bowled them so often.A yorker is a ball pitched on or inside the popping crease. A full pitch is a ball that the batsmen can reach before it hits the ground.</p>
