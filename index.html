            <h2>If there is no cricket in the heaven,<br>then I don't want to be there</h2>
            <p>Cricket is without a doubt religion in India and we treat players as gods of this religion.Cricket may not be the game of India but it is still played in our country with full joy and enthusiasm. In a nation where even young children are crazy about this game, they play it in small open spaces, especially on the roads and parks.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            People have so much passion for cricket in India that people take leaves for matches, they reschedule their meetings and plans. They even watch matches for hours as it takes 12 hours for an ODI match to get over. They even watch its analysis for several hours. People have photos of cricketers at their homes, they have their tattoos on their bodies. Some spectators even have dedicated their whole lives to cricket.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With cricket being a religion in India, every major win by the national team is celebrated with great pomp and show. The streets are deserted on the occasion of every major final match and when we win, they light up like the festival of Diwali. The joy , entusiam and the love which this sport has attained surely makes this sport a RELIGION in India.</p>
